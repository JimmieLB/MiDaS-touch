# MiDaS touch

This program takes an image file as an input and creates a 3D representation of the image for use in a 3d printer. 
The purpose is to automate the creation of tactile representations of paintings for blind or visually impaired people.

A depth-map estimation ai is used called "MiDaS" and the result of the depth map is extruded from a rectangle. The project uses
the MiDaS ai and is used to create a 3d-printed object hence the name "MiDaS-touch"
